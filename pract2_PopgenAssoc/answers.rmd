#Exercise 1 - Estimating minor allele frequencies

> (1) What are these files, what does each of them contain?

chr16_maf.log - A Plink log file describing what was done

chr16_maf.frq - A results file containing the Minor Allele Frquencies, one line per SNP.


> (2) What is the minor allele and the minor allele frequency for rs758033? (hint: A1 is the minor allele)

T 0.25

#Exercise 2 - Hardy Weinberg Equilbrium

> (3) Is the SNP rs758033 In HWE?

The p-value for the test in 0.03256. This is below 0.05, but given the number of tests this is not sginificant.

The null hypothesis is no difference between observed and expected (under HWE). We cannot reject the null hypothesis, so there is no evidence that rs758033 is not in HWE.

#Exercise 3 - Association testing with Plink

> (4) What are the two alleles at this SNP? What is the minor allele frequency? Is this SNP in HWE?

T/G MAF(T)=0.39 HWE(P)=0.71 - The SNP is in HWE.

> (5) Have a look at these files and write down the column names for BMI, sex and age (case-sensitive). You will need to know these for the next command.

phen.txt: BMI

covs.txt: sex, age


> (6) What are the results?

BETA = 0.6503

95% CI = 0.4753 - 0.8253

PVALUE = 3.5x10-13

> (7) Write a sentence that fully describes this result (think about which allele is the BMI increasing allele).

rs3751812 is associated with BMI (p=3.5x10-13), with a 0.65kg/m2 increase in BMI per T allele.
