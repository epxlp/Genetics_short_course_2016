> (1) When is `less â€“S {file}` a better command to use to have a quick look at a file?

less -S is useful for wide files as it does not wrap each line. 
Instead it only shows the top left corner of a file. 
For ped files with thousands of columns, this is a much better command than less (without -S) or head.


> (2) What do you think the 4 columns in a .map file are?

Chromosome, SNP rsID, unused (cM), base position

> (3) How many variants are there in this dataset?

7092

> (4) How many individuals are there in this dataset?

8237

> (5) How many columns are there in the .ped file before the genetic data columns? What might these be?

6: Family ID, Individual ID, Mother ID, Father ID, sex, phenotype

> (6) What are the 2 possible alleles for the first SNP in the dataset? What is the name of this SNP?

T/G rs5747968

> (7) Search for SNP rs7288409. What is the bp position for this SNP?

18542311

> (8) What is the difference between a .bim and a .map file?

.bim files have extra columns of the two alleles to allow the data to be stored more efficiently.

> (9) What is the difference between a .fam and a .ped file?

A .fam file contains only the first 6 columns of a .ped file. 


> (10) Above, you listed the possible alleles for rs5747968 (hopefully as G & T). If we were to represent the data as dosage of G, what would the dosages be for the first 8 people in the dataset?
